This is  repository for different kinds of QGIS short instructions. Collaboration is most welcome!

The topics originate from typical tasks in QGIS that I find interesting or maybe someone has asked about how to do something. In some cases, the document show one way of doing something (feel free to correct, expand, add alternatives...). In other cases it may simply show some interesting setting, situation, dataset...

Some of the instructions may be in Finnish... if you are a native Finnish speaker, please help yourself in correcting my text!).
